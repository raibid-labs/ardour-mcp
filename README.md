**Model Context Protocol server for Ardour DAW - Control Ardour through AI assistants**

The first MCP integration for a major open-source Digital Audio Workstation. Ardour MCP enables natural language control of [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) through AI assistants like Claude, using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## 🎯 What This Does

Control Ardour using natural language through Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible client:

- **"Start recording on tracks 1 and 2, then set up punch recording from bar 5 to bar 9"**
- **"Create 4 audio tracks for drums: Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat, Overhead"**
- **"Set track 1 volume to -6dB, pan it 30% left, and mute track 4"**
- **"Send the vocal track to reverb bus at -12dB"**
- **"Set gain automation to write mode on track 3"**
- **"Check for phase issues and clipping in my mix"**
- **"What's the LUFS loudness of the master output?"**

No commands to memorize - just describe what you want!

## ✨ Current Status

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Complete setup in under 5 minutes!**

### Prerequisites

- **Ardour 8.x or 9.x** installed
- **Python 3.11+** (Python 3.10 also supported)
- **Claude Desktop or Claude Code** (or any MCP-compatible client)

### Installation

```bash
# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/raibid-labs/ardour-mcp.git
cd ardour-mcp
uv sync --all-extras
```

### Configure Ardour OSC

**This is the most important step!**

1. Launch Ardour and open/create a session
2. Go to **Edit → Preferences → Control Surfaces**
3. Enable **"Open Sound Control (OSC)"**
4. Click **"Show Protocol Settings"**
5. Configure:
   - **OSC Server Port**: `3819` (default)
   - **Feedback**: Enable **all feedback options**
   - Click **OK**

### Configure MCP Client

Choose your client:

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b> (Recommended - One command!)</summary>

**Using CLI** (easiest):
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio ardour --scope user \
  -- uv --directory /absolute/path/to/ardour-mcp run ardour-mcp
```

**Manual configuration** - Add to `.mcp.json` in your project or `~/.claude.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ardour": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/absolute/path/to/ardour-mcp",
        "run",
        "ardour-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Verify installation**:
```bash
claude mcp list
claude mcp get ardour
```

The server should show as "✓ Connected". That's it - ardour-mcp is now available in Claude Code!

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ardour": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/absolute/path/to/ardour-mcp",
        "run",
        "ardour-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and the server will be available.

## 🎬 Example Workflows

### Recording Session Setup

```
You: "I want to record a band. Set up 4 audio tracks called 'Kick', 'Snare',
     'Guitar', and 'Vocals'. Arm the kick and snare for recording and enable
     input monitoring on all of them."

Claude: ✓ Created audio tracks
        ✓ Armed tracks for recording
        ✓ Enabled input monitoring
        Your session is ready to record!

You: "Start recording!"

Claude: ✓ Recording started with 2 armed tracks
```

### Professional Mixing

```
You: "Set up parallel compression: create a bus called 'Parallel Comp',
     send all drum tracks to it at -10dB, and keep the original tracks active"

Claude: ✓ Created bus 'Parallel Comp'
        ✓ Routed drum tracks with sends at -10dB
        ✓ Original tracks remain active
        Your parallel compression chain is ready!

You: "Check my mix for phase issues and clipping"

Claude: Master: -8.2dB peak, -14.5 LUFS, no clipping ✓
        Phase correlation: +0.85 (good stereo image) ✓
        ⚠ Track 1 (Drums): Phase correlation -0.15 (check phase)
```

### Automation Recording

```
You: "Set track 3 to touch mode for gain automation, go to bar 8,
     and start playback so I can ride the fader"

Claude: ✓ Track 3: Gain automation set to TOUCH mode
        ✓ Positioned at bar 8
        ✓ Playback started
        Move the fader - automation is recording!
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Ardour MCP uses a three-layer architecture for bidirectional communication:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   AI Assistant  │  Claude Desktop, etc.
└────────┬────────┘
         │ MCP Protocol (stdio)
┌────────▼────────┐
│   MCP Server    │  ardour_mcp
│  ┌──────────┐   │
│  │  Tools   │   │  111 registered tools
│  └────┬─────┘   │
│  ┌────▼─────┐   │
│  │  State   │   │  Cached Ardour state with auto-updates
│  └────┬─────┘   │
│  ┌────▼─────┐   │
│  │OSC Bridge│   │  Bidirectional OSC communication
│  └────┬─────┘   │
└───────┼─────────┘
        │ OSC Protocol (UDP)
┌───────▼─────────┐
│     Ardour      │  Digital Audio Workstation
└─────────────────┘
```

**Key Features**:
- **Bidirectional OSC**: Send commands and receive real-time feedback
- **State Caching**: Fast queries without OSC round-trips
- **Automatic Updates**: State synchronizes with Ardour changes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error messages

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed design.
